Every day I solve IT Problems, yes this is what you have to do as an IT Professional or Developer. But now, when I look back to my few years of experiance I realise, I don't remember all the stuff I learned. I often catch me when I face a Problem that I already solved once. But what have I done? - No Idea... so I had to solve the same Problem near from scratch. And this is the reason I startet this blog. To track and document my experiances that I learn over the time.
